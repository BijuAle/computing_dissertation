\section{Ethical \& Professional Consideration}
\epigraph{\justify``The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity.''}{Proverbs 11:3}

The domain of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has seen ethical repercussions when left unchecked. From the conspicuous case of a pedestrian fatality in 2018 in Arizona involving an autonomous vehicle \parencite{wakabayashi_self-driving_2018}, to a more subtle case of inheritance of systemic bias into a machine learning algorithm \parencite{shaw_artificial_2018}, it is evident that the fragility of machines can take its toll on humanity. And this is where human's exceptional realization of objective morality needs to apply normative guidelines of ethics in building intelligent systems.

My research is largely devoid of human subjects and does not cater to service provision akin to commercial value gains or business optimisation. Rather it is purely a scientific undertaking of empirical studies involving cosmic objects, namely galaxies, their properties, and their data manipulation. In this regard, much of the ethical issues such as privacy concerns and data protection issues are more critical for example in health care systems than academic studies as this. However, this postulate should not be assumed to suggest indifference to ethical or professional considerations. It is just that they vary depending on the nature of the project.

In my research and design, I have followed the \textbf{8 principles} of responsible machine learning activity developed by the British think-tank, `The Institute for Ethical AI \& Machine Learning' focused on developing practical frameworks for ethical intelligent computing \parencite*{the_institute_for_ethical_ai_&_machine_learning_machine_2019}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Human Augmentation}: I commit to assess the impact of failed predictions and introduce human-in-the-loop review.
	\item \textbf{Bias Evaluation}: I commit to constantly monitor and record biases in my machine learning application's predictions during training and production.
	\item \textbf{Explain ability By Justification}: I commit to promote transparency in the working mechanisms of my machine learning system with the aid of any tools and processes I can avail.
	\item \textbf{Reproducible Operations}: I commit to document and explain with illustrations how my system was built from the initiation to the deployment.
	\item \textbf{Displacement Strategy}: I commit to partner with domain experts and relevant stakeholders to explain my system and elicit approval from legal and professional bodies if its deployment involves a change in the human resource structure in the area of deployment.
	\item \textbf{Practical Accuracy}: I commit to ensuring my model's predictive accuracy by leveraging the optimum number of approaches, strategies, and tools in my reach while I explain accuracy and implication of predictions with visuals such as confusion matrices or illustrations.
	\item \textbf{Trust By Privacy}: I commit to being transparent with the dataset and their source I employ to train my models. I shall build trust with pertinent stakeholders by clearly informing them of the ways the data is being manipulated.
	\item \textbf{Data Risk Awareness}: I commit to design, develop, and improve the processes and resources to ensure integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity of my data.
