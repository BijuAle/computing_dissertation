\section*{Acknowledgement}\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgement}
I am grateful to my supervisor Manoj Shrestha, senior lecturer cum the head of the academic strategy at Softwarica College in Kathmandu.\newline

Heartfelt gratitude is due to Dr William Lane Craig, the research professor of Philosophy at Biola University, who galvanised in me the existential questions of ultimate origin, meaning, morality, and destiny; and taught me the life of the mind. I am indebted to Dr Tara Murphy and Dr Simon Murphy, professors of Computational Astronomy at the University of Sydney whose MOOC on `Data-driven Astronomy' laid in me the foundations of applied machine learning to solve astronomical problems.\newline

Thank you to my lord and saviour Jesus of Nazareth. He is the sole embodiment of the truth, the way, and the life, who strengthens me.\newline
